#### My first project in PyCharm 

During the course called Learning Python with PyCharm on LinkedIn Learning, [course link here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-python-with-pycharm/what-is-pycharm?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=true&u=122094402 ) I had the pleasure of learning Python programming with PyCharm, the cross-platform IDE that "takes care of the routine." I got my development environment set up correctly with instructor Bruce Van Horn's step-by-step guidance, and explored PyCharm's first-rate text editing tools. Learned how to improve my code quality with Lens Mode and Intentions, refactor and debug code, and performed unit testing with the PyCharm test runner. Then dived into working with SQL databases(SQLLite). Lastly, learned how to integrate Python with web projects that include HTML and JavaScript, and created a project with the Flask microframework.

## Learning objectives:
- Installing the PyCharm, Git, and Pypy packages
- Adding functions
- Refactoring code
- Calling packages
- Debugging code
- Creating databases
- Working with in-line SQL
- Creating web projects with PyCharm
- Skills covered
- Python (Programming Language)Pycharm
